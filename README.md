Gold Price Prediction Repository :-

This repository contains code and resources for predicting gold prices using machine learning techniques.

Overview:-
Gold has been a valuable asset for centuries, and predicting its price movements can be crucial for investors and traders. This project aims to forecast gold prices based on historical data using various machine learning algorithms.

Dataset:-
The dataset used for training and testing the prediction models consists of historical gold prices over a specific period. It includes features such as date, opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, and trading volume.

Models:-
Several machine learning models are implemented in this repository for gold price prediction, including:

Linear Regression
Support Vector Regression (SVR)
Random Forest Regression

Results:-
Evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared are calculated to assess the performance of each model. Visualizations are provided to compare predicted vs. actual gold prices.

Future Work:-
Incorporate additional features such as economic indicators, geopolitical events, and market sentiment for better predictions.
Explore advanced deep learning architectures for time series forecasting.
Optimize model hyperparameters and implement ensemble methods for improved accuracy.
Develop a web application or API for real-time gold price predictions.
